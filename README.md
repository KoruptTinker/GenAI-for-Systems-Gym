## Acknowledgement
This repo offers a gym environment to facilitate research on Generative AI for Systems, particularly for the cache replacement problem in CPU Architecture Design, and for students registered in the course ECE/CSC 592 - Gen AI for Systems taught by Dr Samira Mirbagher Ajorpaz at NC State University. This repository is built by the combined efforts of the graduate students at Dr. Ajorpaz's research lab and the first batch of students registered in ECE 592. This gym enivornment is built on top of the well-established and maintained Championship Simulator - ChampSim and the previous work done by Google Research & Stanford teams - Parrot.
